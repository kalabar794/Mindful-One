AUDIO FILES PLACEHOLDER

In a production environment, you would place actual audio files in these directories:

1. /audio/meditations/ - For guided meditation narrations
2. /audio/backgrounds/ - For ambient background sounds
3. /audio/sleep-stories/ - For sleep story narrations

Since we're using a development environment, the app will gracefully handle missing audio files.
The AudioService is fully implemented and ready to use with real audio files.

To add real audio files:
1. Place MP3 files in the appropriate directories
2. Make sure the filenames match those in src/data/audioData.js
3. Restart the development server

Example file structure:
/audio/meditations/quick-calm.mp3
/audio/backgrounds/gentle-waves.mp3
/audio/sleep-stories/ocean-journey.mp3

The audio functionality is fully implemented and will work once real audio files are added.
